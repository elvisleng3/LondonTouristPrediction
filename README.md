# LondonTouristPrediction
This is the practicum project I did with Deloitte in order to analyze the spending and visiting patterns of London's tourists. 

# Tools Used
In this project, I used Python and R. I used python mainly for data cleaning and model building. I maily used ggplot in R to build interactive visulizations. 

# Data Source
The “international- visitors-london-raw.csv” data set is a wrangled data from Office for National Statistics (ONS)
 The “PI_All_data_2007-2017.xlsx” is a dataset published by “The Legatum Institute Foundation” in 2017.
